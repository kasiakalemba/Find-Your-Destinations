## Summary
We have created a map with an interactive dashboard for anyone looking to decide which state to travel to. Our webpage provides you a choropleth on the most popular states to travel to based on a equation created by our group. By clicking on each state, you can find information on various attractions offered, average flight costs and the value of your money there. Explore the map to find your ideal destination right at your footsteps!

## Motivation
This app was created during the Covid pandemic, when Americans were not allowed to travel outside of the US, so why not find the perfect destination in your own country? With so many options of places to travel to even just within the US, it can be overwhelming to decide where to go for your vacation. This app can help you decide by displaying various charts with information related to each state's attractions, airfare, hotel ratings, and dollar value.
